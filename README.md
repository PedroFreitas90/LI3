University's project that read and processes information contained in xml's files .

We had access to a Stackoverflow's dump that contained information about users,posts,tags and votes. We should read each xml file
and upload to any structs choosen by ourselvs. Then we had to process that information through querys such as: Top N users (by 
reputation), the top N answers (by votes), etc.

This project had 2 different stages:
  -The first stage was made in C language, and we were advised to use glib (C library that help us to organize our information in 
Binary Trees, AVL's our HashMap's already defined).
  -The second stage was made in Java language.
